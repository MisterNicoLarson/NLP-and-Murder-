== Early life ==
Jaishankar, a son of Maarimuttu,&lt;ref name="NIE_2018" /&gt; came from the [[Kanniyanpatti]] village of [[Salem district]], [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/rapist-murderer-psycho-shankar-found-dead-bengaluru-prison-cops-suspect-suicide-77109 |title=Rapist, murderer 'Psycho' Shankar found dead in Bengaluru prison, cops suspect suicide |publisher=The News Minute |date=27 February 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228195541/https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/rapist-murderer-psycho-shankar-found-dead-bengaluru-prison-cops-suspect-suicide-77109 |archive-date=28 February 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, he was reported to be a married man with three daughters.&lt;ref name="ToI_held_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/Serial-killer-held-in-Karnataka/articleshow/8165242.cms |title=Serial killer held in Karnataka |author=A Subburaj |newspaper=The Times of India |date=5 May 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003095259/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/Serial-killer-held-in-Karnataka/articleshow/8165242.cms |archive-date=3 October 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career as a truck driver.&lt;ref name="ToI_Salem_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Criminal-rapes-kills-6-women-after-escape-from-Salem/articleshow/8103461.cms |title=Criminal rapes, kills 6 women after escape from Salem |date=28 April 2011 |newspaper=The Times of India |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928023421/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Criminal-rapes-kills-6-women-after-escape-from-Salem/articleshow/8103461.cms |archive-date=28 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal history==
Jaishankar started his criminal activities around 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/crime/bed-ridden-and-lonely-rapist-psycho-shankar-slits-his-throat/articleshow/63100037.cms |title=Bed-ridden and 'Lonely', rapist Psycho Shankar slits his throat |newspaper=Bangalore Mirror |date=28 February 2008 |author=Praveen Kumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first crime to be reported happened on 3 July 2009, when he attempted to rape and murder 45-year-old P. Shyamala in Perandahalli.&lt;ref name="ToI_control_2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/M-Shankar-alias-Jaishankar-has-no-control-over-criminal-instinct/articleshow/22217646.cms |title=M Shankar alias Jaishankar has no control over criminal instinct |newspaper=The Times of India |date=2 September 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924123251/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/M-Shankar-alias-Jaishankar-has-no-control-over-criminal-instinct/articleshow/22217646.cms |archive-date=24 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2009, he had raped and murdered 12 women, and raped another six women. He always carried a black hand bag with him. He kept a machete in this bag, and killed whoever resisted him. He used to kidnap [[sex worker]]s near [[Punjabi dhaba|dhabas]] (roadside restaurants) on highways, rape them and kill them brutally. He also targeted women in farm houses, in rural areas.&lt;ref name="DNA_psycho_2011" /&gt;

=== First arrest (2009) ===
On 23 August 2009, Jaishankar raped and murdered a 39-year-old police constable, M. Jayamani. Originally stationed at the [[Kangeyam]] all-women police station, Jayamani was on temporary duty at [[Perumanallur]], during the visit of deputy chief minister [[M. K. Stalin]]. Jaishankar kidnapped her, and raped her several times before killing her. The police recovered Jayamani's body a month later, on 19 September.&lt;ref name="ToI_Salem_2011" /&gt;

Jaishankar and his partner in crime P Mohan Selvam were charged with the murder of 50-year-old K. Thangammal Ponnaya in Namakkal on 10 September 2009. (Later, in 2014, the two were acquitted in this case, due to insufficient evidence resulting from lapses in investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Namakkal-Court-Acquits-Jaishankar-in-Murder-Case/2014/02/01/article2031698.ece |title=Namakkal Court Acquits Jaishankar in Murder Case |date=1 February 2014 |newspaper=The New Indian Express |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714151528/http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Namakkal-Court-Acquits-Jaishankar-in-Murder-Case/2014/02/01/article2031698.ece |archive-date=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The [[Tiruppur]] police launched a manhunt for Jaishankar, and arrested him on 19 October 2009. He was jailed at the [[Coimbatore Central Prison]]. By this time, he had been charged with 13 separate counts of rape and murder in Tiruppur, [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] and Dharmapuri.&lt;ref name="ToI_Salem_2011" /&gt; He revealed, while remanded in custody, that he enjoyed torturing women before he raped and killed them.&lt;ref name="DNA_psycho_2011" /&gt;

==== First escape (2011) ====
On 17 March 2011, the police took Jaishankar to a fast-track court in Dharmapuri, for a murder case trial. The next day, armed reserve police constables M. Chinnasamy and Rajavelu were assigned to escort him back to Coimbatore. On the way, Jaishankar managed to escape at the Salem bus stand, around 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. On 19 March, Chinnasamy [[Suicide|shot himself]].&lt;ref name="ToI_Salem_2011" /&gt;

=== 2011 murder spree in Bellary ===
Jaishankar escaped to [[Karnataka]], where he raped and murdered six women in [[Bellary]] over the next month. He also killed a man and a child in Dharmapuri. In the last week of April 2011, the police traced his mobile phone to [[Delhi]]. The police initially believed that he had discarded his mobile phone in Delhi.&lt;ref name="ToI_Salem_2011" /&gt; However, in May 2011, the police traced his mobile calls to Mumbai, but he stopped using his mobile phone. A special team, comprising two sub-inspectors and 15 other police personnel, was assigned to find and arrest him.&lt;ref name="ToI_Mumbai_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/Coimbatore-serial-killer-traced-to-Mumbai/articleshow/8147595.cms |title=Coimbatore serial killer traced to Mumbai |author=A Subburaj |newspaper=The Times of India |date=3 May 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712183044/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/Coimbatore-serial-killer-traced-to-Mumbai/articleshow/8147595.cms |archive-date=12 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second arrest (2011) ===
By May 2011, the police had put up [[wanted poster]]s seeking information about Jaishankar, in public places across Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. On the night of 4 May 2011, Jaishankar reached Elagi village in Karnataka, on a stolen motorcycle. He approached a woman, Chandrakala Hotagi, who was working alone in a field, and asked her for water and food. He then tried to rape her, but Chandrakala raised the alarm. Her husband, Prakash Hotagi, and a friend came to her rescue. Jaishankar tried to flee, but was caught by Prakash and other villagers. The locals brought him to the Zalaki police station. He was handed over to the Chitradurga police on 5 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/this-family-fears-revenge-by-serial-rapist/article5094958.ece |title=This family fears revenge by serial rapist |author=Firoz Rozindar |date=5 September 2013 |newspaper=The Hindu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830235419/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/this-family-fears-revenge-by-serial-rapist/article5094958.ece |archive-date=30 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Second escape (2013) ====
After his 2011 arrest, Jaishankar was kept at the [[Central Prison, Bangalore|Parappana Agrahara Central Jail]] in [[Bangalore]]. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison.&lt;ref name="IT_how_2013" /&gt; At the Bangalore jail, he underwent treatment for psychiatric problems.&lt;ref name="ToI_control_2013" /&gt; On 31 August 2013, the police took Jaishankar to the court in [[Tumkur]] near Bangalore. After returning, Jaishankar feigned uneasiness and was admitted to the hospital within the prison premises. He managed to secure a duplicate key and used it at 2 a.m. on 1 September 2013, when the daily change of guards took place. The police suspected that an insider helped him get the duplicate key.&lt;ref name="IT_how_2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/psycho-shankar-how-serial-rapist-killer-was-nabbed/1/308631.html |title=Psycho Shankar – How the serial rapist and killer was nabbed |date=6 September 2013 |publisher=India Today |author=TS Sudhir, Rohini Swamy and Shreesha Reddy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710200427/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/psycho-shankar-how-serial-rapist-killer-was-nabbed/1/308631.html |archive-date=10 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scaled a 20-foot (6.1&amp;nbsp;m) wall, then walked atop a 15-foot (4.6&amp;nbsp;m) wall and finally scaled the 30-foot (9.1&amp;nbsp;m) high compound wall. He managed to cross the [[electric fence]] safely, since it was not functional that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Serial-rapist-killer-Jaishankar-planned-escape-over-two-months/articleshow/22382895.cms |title=Serial rapist-killer Jaishankar planned escape over two months |date=7 September 2013 |newspaper=The Times of India |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924123646/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Serial-rapist-killer-Jaishankar-planned-escape-over-two-months/articleshow/22382895.cms |archive-date=24 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly carried with him a bamboo pole balancing on the walls and a bedsheet to serve as a cushion over the glass pieces on the wall top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.deccanchronicle.com/130902/news-current-affairs/article/prison-wall-not-high-enough-stop-serial-rapist |title=Prison wall not high enough to stop serial rapist |date=2 September 2013 |newspaper=Deccan Herald |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714192448/http://archives.deccanchronicle.com/130902/news-current-affairs/article/prison-wall-not-high-enough-stop-serial-rapist |archive-date=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was injured during the escape, and drops of blood were found outside the outer wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oneindia.com/india/bangalore-serial-psycho-killer-jaishankar-arrested-1300791.html |title=B'lore: Serial pyscho-killer Jaishankar arrested |date=6 September 2013 |author=Vijay Shankar |publisher=One India |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711083736/http://www.oneindia.com/india/bangalore-serial-psycho-killer-jaishankar-arrested-1300791.html |archive-date=11 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly wearing a police uniform during his escape. 11 jail staff, including three wardens, two jailors and six security guards, were suspended following his escape to reprimand them for allowing the escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/todays-newspaper/runaway-serial-rapist-killer-shankar-held.html |title=Runaway serial rapist-killer Shankar held |date=7 September 2013 |newspaper=The Pioneer |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711003622/http://www.dailypioneer.com/todays-newspaper/runaway-serial-rapist-killer-shankar-held.html |archive-date=11 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police issued a red alert to all police stations in Karnataka, and urged women to be careful in isolated places.&lt;ref name="DNA_psycho_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-bangalore-watch-out-theres-a-psycho-on-the-loose-1883827 |title=Bangalore: Watch out, there's a psycho on the loose |date=3 September 2015 |newspaper=DNA |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710213621/http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-bangalore-watch-out-theres-a-psycho-on-the-loose-1883827 |archive-date=10 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They announced a reward of {{Indian Rupee}}&amp;nbsp;500,000 for any information leading to his arrest. They also analyzed his psychology and life history to predict his next actions.&lt;ref name="IT_how_2013" /&gt; Besides this, the police printed 10,000 wanted posters and 75,000 pamphlets with different photographic profiles of Jaishankar, in five languages&amp;nbsp;— Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu. Besides Karnataka, these posters and pamphlets were distributed across Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/runaway-serial-rapist-arrested-near-bangalore-27499.html |title=Serial rapist killer Jaishankar arrested five days after sensational escape |date=6 September 2013 |publisher=India TV |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710175455/http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/runaway-serial-rapist-arrested-near-bangalore-27499.html |archive-date=10 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third arrest (2013) ===
During his escape, Jaishankar had fractured his leg while jumping from the 30-foot (9.1&amp;nbsp;m) high wall of the prison compound. He did not contact his family in Tamil Nadu. Soon after his escape, a police informant managed to get in touch with him. The informant lured him to a dilapidated building near the Kudlu gate in Bangalore, with the promise of a motorbike to facilitate his escape outside the city. There, the police arrested Jaishankar, at noon on 6 September 2013.&lt;ref name="IT_how_2013" /&gt; The Government spent over {{Indian Rupee}}&amp;nbsp;75,000 treating his fractured leg at the [[Victoria Hospital (Bangalore Medical College)|Victoria Hospital]], where he was operated on, on 23 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/crime/Rs-75K-spent-on-serial-rapist-killers-surgery/articleshow/23114115.cms |title=Rs 75K spent on serial rapist-killer's surgery |date=23 September 2013 |newspaper=Bangalore Mirror |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711214334/http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/crime/Rs-75K-spent-on-serial-rapist-killers-surgery/articleshow/23114115.cms |archive-date=11 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surgery on his leg having been completed, Jaishankar was sent to [[Central Prison, Bangalore]] to begin serving his sentence. He was kept in a high-security cell, with 24/7 [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] monitoring and extra lights. The lock of his cell was designed to be out of his reach. It was decided that in case of an illness, he would be treated inside his cell, instead of being taken to a hospital. The police also decided to deploy extra security while escorting him to trials to minimize the likelihood of an escape.&lt;ref name="IT_how_2013" /&gt;

== Death ==
