'''Ronald Alain Janssen''' (born February 6, 1971 in Boorsem, [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg Province]]) is a Belgian [[serial killer]] who was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on October 21, 2011 for the murder of three people.&lt;ref name="jans"&gt;{{Citeweb|language=french|title=Ronald Janssen: the confessions of a serial killer|url=http://www.dhnet.be/actu/faits/ronald-janssen-les-aveux-du-tueur-en-serie-51b778f6e4b0de6db97d5cb4|publisher=rtl.be|author=Gilbert Dupont|date=17 September 2011|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="portrait"&gt;{{Citeweb|language=french|title=Ronald Janssen, portrait of a killer of the night|url=http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1724/Meurtre-d-Annick/article/detail/1323107/2011/09/23/Ronald-Janssen-portrait-d-un-tueur-de-la-nuit.dhtml|publisher=7sur7.be|date=23 October 2011|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Ronald Alain Janssen was born on February 6, 1971 in Boorsem, the third child in a family of four.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} His father was a miner and his mother was a housekeeper. From early childhood Janssen was teased at school for his [[lisp]]. His father was depressed and severe at the "tyrannical limit". At home, Ronald was terrorized by his father. This fear caused him to have insomnia, which he kept throughout his life. He allegedly tried to murder his diabetic father by injecting him with a liquid instead of insulin. His mother Hilda had a strong relationship with her son, which dated from the time that Ronald's father was brutal with the family. When Hilda decided to divorce, all four children chose to continue living with their mother.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

He studied at [[Hasselt]] and [[Leuven]]. In 1993, he graduated as an industrial engineer with distinction. That year he also met his future wife Natalie.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In 1996, the couple moved to [[Genk]], where Natalie found a job. After being active as a technical and production manager in a company in Genk, he turned to teaching in 1998. At Maaseik, he taught mechanics and computer science until 2000.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In the middle of 2000, he moved with his wife and daughters to [[Loksbergen]]. Janssen then became a professor at Herk-De-Stad where he taught computer science, economics, technology and applied mechanics.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

His wife left him in 2006, leaving Janssen to live alone. While in Loksbergen, neighbours would sometimes find him walking alone at night while everyone was sleeping.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

== The criminal case ==

=== Annick Van Uytsel (18) ===
Annick Van Uytsel, an 18-year-old [[Diest]] resident, was returning to her home alone while riding a bike on April 27 to 28, 2007. Threatening her with a knife, Janssen kidnapped her and took her to his home, where he killed Van Uytsel with a hammer, then held her head under water to make sure she did not survive. 70 police officers, 200 volunteers and a helicopter began searching for the woman. A telephone terminal was activated by Annick's [[GSM]], and her mother called her while she was still at Janssen's, which allowed the police to work in a specific sector where 4000 men between 35 and 40 years were interviewed, but the killer still managed to slip through the cracks. Annick's body was found on May 3, 2007 in Lummel in the [[Albert Canal]], weighted down with 14.5 kilos of stones. Her bike, partially repainted by Janssen to confuse the police, was found months later in Leuven.&lt;ref name="jans" /&gt;

=== Shana Appeltans (18) and Kevin Paulus (22) ===
On the night of Saturday, January 2, 2010, Janssen met his neighbour Shana Appeltans and her boyfriend Kevin Paulus, who were returning from a night out at a coffee shop in the area. He fetched a weapon and a flammable product, then rang the couple's doorbell. Under the threat of a gun, Janssen forced them to board Kevin's [[Opel Corsa]]. While Kevin was driving, Janssen sat next to him and Shana was in the back. He told Kevin to stop near a path, where he shot both of them several times. Back home, he burned his blood-covered clothes in the stove and scattered the ashes in a ditch, then threw his weapon in the [[Demer]]. At 2:43, firefighters were called for a car on fire. The autopsy on the couple's bodies proved that they were murdered.&lt;ref name="laisser partir"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhnet.be/actu/faits/shana-a-supplie-de-la-laisser-partir-51b778c3e4b0de6db97d5590|date=17 September 2011|author=Gilbert Dupont|title=Shana begged for her life|publisher=dhnet.be|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrested by the police two days later on Tuesday, January 4, 2010, Janssen confessed to the crime the same evening. He also admitted to raping Shana, but later recanted that statement.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=== Rapes ===
Ronald Janssen admitted to committing three rapes while studying in Leuven, but did not provide any evidence and said he no longer remembered the names or dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtl.be/info/belgique/faits-divers/ronald-janssen-il-reconnait-une-serie-de-viols-a-louvain-146849.aspx|date=12 January 2010|title=Ronald Janssen: he recognizes the rapes in Leuven|publisher=rtl.be|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He admitted to a total of 5 rapes, but he is suspected of 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lesoir.be/archive/recup/ronald-janssen-aurait-commis-d-8217-autres-meurtres_t-20100112-00RRV8.html|date=12 January 2010|title=Ronald Janssen allegedly committed other murders|publisher=lesoir.be|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acts were committed between 2001 and 2010, with Janssen threatening his victims with a knife.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

== Trial ==
Ronald Janssen's trial began on Tuesday, September 20, 2011, in Limbourg. The trial was chaired by Michel Jordens, assisted by Herline Wilmots and Niels Bollen. The prosecutor was Patrick Boyen. Janssen was defended by Zvonimir Miskovic, while Jef Vermassen represented Van Uytsel's parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/proces-ronald-janssen-quatre-semaines-pour-cerner-un-tueur-en-serie/article-normal-156505.html|date=20 October 2011|title=Ronald Janssen tria: four weeks to identify a serial killer|publisher=levif.be|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cinq semaines"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lesoir.be/archive/recup/428522/article/soirmag/actu-soirmag/2014-02-14/cinq-semaines-pour-juger-serial-killer-belge|date=14 February 2014|title=Five weeks to judge Belgian serial killer|publisher=lesoir.be|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his indictment, Advocate General Patrick Boyer asked for the maximum sentence by saying: "I will make sure that you stay in prison until your last breath. You are a psychopath, a rapist, torturer and serial killer."

One month after the start of the trial, the court jury found Ronald Janssen guilty on charges without mitigating circumstances, that is of three murders, kidnapping and rape with torture.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

On Friday, October 21, 2011, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

During his second trial, which began on Monday, September 10, 2012 in the Limburg Criminal Court in Hasselt, he was convicted of a dozen rapes with violence, sexual assault with a weapon, several attempted murders and acts of torture and barbarities. But given his life imprisonment sentence on October 21, 2011, the second verdict did not give Janssen any additional prison time.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}
