==Names==
Shi Jianqiao's given name was Shi Gulan, ({{zh|t={{linktext|施|谷|蘭}}|s={{linktext|施|谷|兰}}|p={{linktext|Shī| Gǔ|lán}}|w=Shih Ku-lan|l=Valley Orchid}}).&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; She adopted the name Shi Jianqiao around the time she was planning to assassinate Sun Chuanfang to avenge her father's killing.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; The characters of her adopted name mean "sword" and "to raise" alluding to her planned role as an avenging assassin.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt;

==Background==
Shi Jianqiao was born in [[Tongcheng, Anhui|Tongcheng City]], [[Anhui]] Province, in the small village of Shazigang.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; While her grandfather had still been a farmer and tofu seller, her father and one of her uncles rose to become decorated soldiers, which led to an increase in the family's social status.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; She grew up in [[Jinan]], [[Shandong]] Province and had her [[Foot binding|feet bound]] as a young girl.&lt;ref name=fang/&gt; By the year he was killed (1925), her father had been promoted to director of military affairs in Shandong Province and served as brigade commander under the local warlord [[Zhang Zongchang]].&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; Zhang Zongchang and hence Shi Congbin were aligned with the [[Fengtian clique]], one of the two main competing warlord factions at the time. By some accounts, Shi Jianqiao graduated from Tianjin Normal College ({{zh|c={{linktext|天|津|師|範|學|校}}|p={{linktext|Tiān|jīn |Shī|fàn |Xué|xiào}}}}).&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt;

In October 1925, during the [[Second Zhili–Fengtian War|second war between the Zhili and Fengtian warlord cliques]], her father Shi Congbin was leading a brigade of mercenary soldiers in an attempt to capture Guzhen, Shandong.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt;  However, he found himself surrounded by troops of the [[Zhili clique|Zhili]] warlord Sun Chuanfang who had been leading a surprise counterattack against the advance of the Fengtian troops.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; The next day, Sun had Shi decapitated and his severed head displayed in public at the train station of [[Bengbu]], Anhui.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; Less than two years later, in early 1927, Sun Chuanfeng was deposed by the [[Northern Expedition]],&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; a military campaign by the [[Kuomintang]] that was targeted at ending the rule of the local warlords. He retired from his military career and founded the Tianjin Qingxiu lay-Buddhist society ({{zh|c={{linktext|天|津|佛|教|居|士|林}}|p={{linktext|Tiān|jīn |Fó|jiào |Jū|shì|lín}}}}) together with his former fellow warlord [[Jin Yunpeng]].&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt;

==Revenge==
[[File:Shi jianqiao pamphlet.jpg|thumb|right|Pamphlet by Shi Jianqiao authenticated with her fingerprint]]
About 10 years after the death of her father, Shi Jianqiao tracked down Sun Chuanfang in Tianjin.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; Shortly after 3pm on 13 November 1935, she approached him from behind while he was leading a sutra-recitation session at his lay-Buddhist society on Nanma Road.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; She then killed the kneeling former warlord by shooting him three times with her [[Browning Arms Company|Browning]] pistol.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; After the assassination, she stayed at the crime scene to explain her deed and distribute [[mimeograph]]ed pamphlets to bystanders.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; Her case drew a significant amount of public and media attention.&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=sheng2009&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; she was finally given a state pardon by the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] government&lt;ref name=lean2007/&gt; on 14 October 1936. The assassination of Sun Chuanfang was ethically justified as an act of filial piety&lt;ref name=lee2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=he2010&gt;

Shi Jianqiao died in 1979, shortly after surgery for advanced colorectal cancer.&lt;ref name=fang/&gt;
Her ashes were buried in the West Tianling Cemetery ({{zh|c={{linktext|西|天|灵|公|墓}}|p={{linktext|Xi |Tiān|líng| Gōng|mù}}}}) in [[Suzhou|Suzhou City]].&lt;ref name=fang/&gt;
