|After Radama passed a controversial law allowing disputes to be settled by duelling, his palace was besieged on the orders of the Prime Minister, [[Rainivoninahitriniony]]. Radama was captured by soldiers and strangled with a silk sash; some historians believe he may have survived this attack and lived out the rest of his days in obscurity.

After the meeting, Carl Weiss, the son-in-law of Long's long-time opponent, Judge Benjamin Henry Pavy, confronted Long, pulled out a handgun and shot Long in the abdomen. Weiss was shot and killed by Long's bodyguards. Long died two days later. An alternative version of events, not generally accepted by historians, is that Long was hit by one of his own bodyguard's bullets as they fired at Weiss.
