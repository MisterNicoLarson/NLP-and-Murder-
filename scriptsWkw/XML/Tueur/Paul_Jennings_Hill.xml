'''Paul Jennings Hill''' (February 6, 1954 â€“ September 3, 2003) was an American minister convicted for the 
anti-abortion motivated killing of physician [[John Britton (doctor)|John Britton]] and Britton's bodyguard James Barrett in 1994. Hill was sentenced to [[capital punishment in the United States|death by lethal injection]] and was executed on September 3, 2003.

==Early life==
Paul Hill was born in [[Miami, Florida]] on February 6, 1954, to Oscar Jennings Hill, an airline pilot, and his wife Louise. He was raised in [[Coral Gables]]. He was charged with assault at the age of 17, by his father, when his father attempted to get treatment for Hill's drug problem.
Hill said he experienced a [[religious conversion]] two years later in 1973, after being sent to a military school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm "Turning From 'Weapon of the Spirit' to the Shotgun"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623151437/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm# |date=2017-06-23 }}, ''Washington Post'', August 7, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Hill later enrolled in [[Belhaven University]] where he met his future wife, Karen Demuth, with whom he would have three children.

==Early career==
Hill graduated from [[Reformed Theological Seminary]], where he studied under [[Greg Bahnsen]], a founder of the right-wing [[Christian Reconstructionist]] movement.&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;''Religion in Today's World: Global Issues, Sociological Perspectives'' By Melissa M. Wilcox. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended St. Paul Presbyterian Church, which espoused [[theonomy]], a movement related to Reconstructionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm|title=WashingtonPost.com: Abortion Violence|work=washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623151437/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm#|archive-date=2017-06-23|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his ordination in 1984, Hill became a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] affiliated with both the [[Presbyterian Church in America]] and the [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]]. He was [[excommunication#Calvin's view on excommunication|excommunicated]] in 1993 following a number of nationally televised appearances in which he claimed to be the new national spokesperson for "defensive action" [[Anti-abortion violence|against abortion providers]] and claimed a connection to the [[Army of God (USA)|Army of God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armyofgod.com/PaulHillWhoIs.html|title=Who Is Paul Hill?|author=Rev. Donald Spitz|work=armyofgod.com|access-date=2007-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608163046/http://www.armyofgod.com/PaulHillWhoIs.html#|archive-date=2007-06-08|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm Turning From 'Weapon of the Spirit' to the Shotgun] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623151437/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm# |date=2017-06-23 }}, ''Washington Post Sunday'', p. A01. August 7, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime, trial, and execution==
On July 29, 1994, Hill approached the [[American Family Planning|Ladies Center]], an abortion clinic in [[Pensacola, Florida]].  When he spotted clinic doctor [[John Britton (doctor)|John Britton]] and his [[bodyguard]], retired [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Lieutenant Colonel James H. Barrett.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jbarrett.htm Arlington National Cemetery records page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209005443/http://arlingtoncemetery.net/jbarrett.htm# |date=2013-02-09 }} James H. Barrett Lieutenant Colonel, United States Air Force&lt;/ref&gt; outside the clinic, he fired on both of them at close range with a [[Mossberg 500|Mossberg]] Model 500A [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] [[pump-action shotgun]].&lt;ref name="USvHill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/criminal-section-selected-case-summaries | title=Criminal Section Selected Case Summaries; Hate Crimes; U.S. vs. Hill | publisher=United States Department of Justice | accessdate=August 16, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825044254/http://www.justice.gov/crt/criminal-section-selected-case-summaries# | archive-date=2015-08-25 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Britton and Barrett died; Barrett's wife, June, was also wounded. Following the shots, Hill laid his shotgun on the ground and waited to be arrested.

Following his arrest, Hill was brought to trial in the Circuit Court of Florida for the First Circuit, charged with two counts of first-degree premeditated murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. Hill moved, successfully, to be allowed to appear [[pro se]]. i.e., he represented himself. He pleaded not guilty on all counts. Hill's motion to use the [[affirmative defense]] of justification was denied. According to Hill, his actions were a defensive act, rather than a retribution. On December 6, 1994, Hill was found guilty of the charges and was sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; Appeals to the First District Court of Appeals, 656 So.2d 1271 (Fla. 1995), and subsequently to the Florida Supreme Court, 688 So.2d 901 (Fla.1996), were unsuccessful. Hill petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of [[certiorari]] (asked the Court to hear his appeal). The petition was denied. 522 U.S. 907 (1997).

The [[execution warrant]] for Hill was not signed until July 2003, at which time it was signed by Governor [[Jeb Bush]]. Hill died by [[lethal injection]] in [[Florida State Prison]] on September 3, 2003, aged 49. His last words were, "If you believe abortion is a lethal force, you should oppose the force and do what you have to do to stop it. May God help you to protect the unborn as you would want to be protected."&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

Hill chose Rev. [[Donald Spitz]] as his spiritual adviser during the last week of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://pilotonline.com/news/article_c2ab92ff-58e8-5432-91d8-c0538170f65b.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925025935/https://pilotonline.com/news/article_c2ab92ff-58e8-5432-91d8-c0538170f65b.html# |archive-date=2018-09-25 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hill was close friends with Spitz both before and after he killed Dr. John Britton and James H. Barrett. Spitz was with Hill during the last week of his life and with Hill when he was executed.

==Motives and aftermath==
Prior to the murders, Hill sent two position papers to [[Christian reconstructionism|Reconstructionist]] author [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], which set out Hill's views of abortion and why he considered murder of abortionists to be warranted. The papers were followed by three additional letters to North in October 1994. North's responses, issued after the murders, comprised two letters that were made available to the public. The letters rejected and refuted Hill's theological arguments, and concluded that, "...the public will regard your dual assassination as the act of a condemned man outside of God's church and acting on his own in defiance of Bible-revealed law and therefore also God's moral law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://s155777461.onlinehome.us/docs/html/gnlg/gnlg.html ''Lone Gunners for Jesus: Letters to Paul J. Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224101646/http://s155777461.onlinehome.us/docs/html/gnlg/gnlg.html |date=2008-02-24 }} by [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] (critical response to Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill spent almost a decade in prison awaiting his execution. In a statement made before his execution, Hill's views on the murders remained unchanged; he said that he felt no [[remorse]] for his actions, and that he expected "a great reward in [[Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/hill873.htm|title=Paul Jennings Hill #873|work=clarkprosecutor.org|access-date=2007-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608031153/http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/hill873.htm#|archive-date=2007-06-08|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill left behind a manuscript manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armyofgod.com/PHillbookIntro.html|title=Mix My Blood with the Blood of the Unborn|author=Paul Jennings Hill|work=armyofgod.com|access-date=2006-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613033629/http://armyofgod.com/PHillbookIntro.html#|archive-date=2006-06-13|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which his backers promised him they would publish. Hill also encouraged others who believe abortion is an illegitimate use of lethal force to "do what you have to do to stop it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armyofgod.com/Paulhillindex.html|title=Writinigs of Paul Jennings Hill|author=Rev.

== In media ==
While in police custody, Hill told the media "Now is the time to defend the unborn as to defend a slave that's about to be murdered." Hill's purported ties to the Army of God movement as well as his life and crimes are explored in the feature length HBO Documentary film ''Soldiers in the Army of God'' (2000) directed by Marc Levin and Daphne Pinkerson as part of HBO's ''America Undercover'' Series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259587/ Soldiers in the Army of God (2000)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428090419/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259587/# |date=2018-04-28 }} released on DVD in 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Lake of Fire (film)|Lake of Fire]]'', a 2006 documentary by [[Tony Kaye (director)|Tony Kaye]] on the [[Abortion debate|abortion controversy]] in the United States, features footage of Hill protesting outside abortion clinics in Florida, and shows footage of Hill's arrest and trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Clinical, but emotional too|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/07/entertainment/ca-lake7|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2007-10-07|access-date = 2015-11-20|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = John|last = Horn|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151121014656/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/07/entertainment/ca-lake7#|archive-date = 2015-11-21|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lake Of Fire|url = http://www.avclub.com/review/lake-of-fire-3261|website = www.avclub.com|accessdate = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120152835/http://www.avclub.com/review/lake-of-fire-3261#|archive-date = 2015-11-20|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill also says to the film-maker that "whatever force is justified in defending the life of a born child is also justified in defending the life of an unborn child."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Right to choose?
